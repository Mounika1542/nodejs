Chapter 7 – File System (Advanced), Streams & Buffers
1. Advanced File System (fs) Module

Node.js fs module lets you read, write, update, delete, and watch files.

Async vs Sync

Async: Non-blocking, preferred

Sync: Blocking, simple for small scripts


2. File Operations
a) Reading Files
fs.readFile("file.txt", "utf8", (err, data) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(data);
});

b) Writing Files
fs.writeFile("file.txt", "Hello Chapter 7!", (err) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log("File written successfully");
});

c) Appending Files
fs.appendFile("file.txt", "\nAppended text", (err) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log("Text appended!");
});

d) Deleting Files
fs.unlink("file.txt", (err) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log("File deleted");
});

e) Renaming Files
fs.rename("file.txt", "newfile.txt", (err) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log("File renamed");
});

3. Streams in Node.js

Streams allow reading/writing large files efficiently without loading everything in memory.

a) Readable Stream
const readStream = fs.createReadStream("largefile.txt", "utf8");
readStream.on("data", (chunk) => {
    console.log("Received chunk:", chunk);
});

b) Writable Stream
const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream("output.txt");
writeStream.write("Hello using writable stream\n");
writeStream.end("Stream finished!");

c) Pipe Streams
const readStream = fs.createReadStream("input.txt");
const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream("output.txt");

readStream.pipe(writeStream);

4. Buffers in Node.js

Buffers are temporary memory storage used to handle binary data in Node.js.

const buf = Buffer.from("Hello Buffer");
console.log(buf.toString()); // Convert to string
console.log(buf.length);      // Size in bytes


Buffers are often used with Streams for faster file and network operations.

5. Summary

fs module → advanced file operations

Async vs Sync operations

Streams → efficiently handle large files

Buffers → store binary data

Pipe → connect readable & writable streams
