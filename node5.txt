Chapter 5 – Events & EventEmitter in Node.js
1. What Are Events in Node.js?

Node.js works on an event-driven architecture.

Events are actions that happen in the system, such as:

File opened

Data received

User clicked

Server started

Node.js uses an EventEmitter class to manage events.

2. EventEmitter

EventEmitter is part of Node.js events module.

Use it like this:

const EventEmitter = require("events");
const emitter = new EventEmitter();


You can:

Create Events

Listen to Events

Emit Events

3. Creating & Listening to Events
Listening to an event
emitter.on("greet", () => {
    console.log("Hello! Event triggered");
});

Emitting an event
emitter.emit("greet");

4. Passing Data with Events

Events can send data to listeners:

emitter.on("message", (name) => {
    console.log("Message from", name);
});

emitter.emit("message", "Mounika");

5. Multiple Listeners for Same Event

One event → multiple listeners:

emitter.on("start", () => console.log("Listener 1"));
emitter.on("start", () => console.log("Listener 2"));

emitter.emit("start");

6. Once() – Listen Only One Time

Use .once() for one-time events:

emitter.once("load", () => {
    console.log("Loaded once!");
});

emitter.emit("load");
emitter.emit("load"); // ignored

7. Real-Life Uses of Events

Events are used in:

Streams

HTTP server

Database actions

User actions

Timers

File system operations

Example:
server.on('request', ...) → Fires whenever a user opens your website.
